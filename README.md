# Docker Flask Project with CI/CD Pipeline

## Experience and Challenges Encountered

During this practical exam, I developed a Flask application with a complete Docker architecture and CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The application exposes a REST API for book management with a PostgreSQL database.

### Main Challenges
- **Optimized Dockerfile** : Creating a secure image with non-privileged user, multi-stage caching and minimal size
- **Docker Compose** : Orchestration with PostgreSQL, secrets management via Docker secrets, and health checks
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** : Two distinct workflows - one for testing (all branches/PRs) and one for deployment (master/main only)
- **Technical Issues** : Resolving YAML errors in workflows, handling `load: true` for Docker Buildx

### Solutions Implemented
Challenges were resolved through a methodical approach: Dockerfile optimization with cached layers, Docker secrets usage for security, and clear separation of responsibilities between test and deployment workflows.

## Next Steps for Production Readiness

### Security
- Vulnerability scanning with Trivy/Snyk
- Automatic secrets rotation
- HTTPS with SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt)
- Network policies and container isolation

### Monitoring & Observability
- Centralized logging (ELK Stack or Grafana Loki)
- Metrics with Prometheus/Grafana
- Advanced health checks and alerting
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin)

### Infrastructure
- Kubernetes orchestration (Helm charts)
- Load balancing and auto-scaling
- Automated database backup
- Multiple environments (dev/staging/prod)

### Advanced CI/CD
- End-to-end integration testing
- Blue-green or canary deployment
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Automated performance validation
